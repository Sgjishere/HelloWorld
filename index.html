          HTML is like the basic starting blocks or foundation for the web. This type of code tells the web browser how to make an image or text appear. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It also gives the form or structure it's web page.

          The reason I chose this Web Page Design was because I would like to one day have my own business. In order to promote a business you need a website. Instead getting someone else to make a website for me, why not learn it on my own? I would get to learn I new skill that could also be useful to others as well. Even if I didn't use it for a business, I could still use it for help update my Church's website or helping others make a website. I think this would be an amazing way to get a new skill and help people promote their business.
